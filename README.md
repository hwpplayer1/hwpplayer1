I’m passionate about Free Software Movement, and building tools that make technology accessible for everyone. I'm a systems programmer , I like GNU Emacs, Assembly , C and C++. I'm working on Linux kernel, GCC, and GNU Emacs on Debian GNU/Linux GNOME.

## Mert Gör's Way to The Free Software

I work full-time to lead to The Free Software Movement globally. This is my main activity and I don't want to give up ... so happy hacking ! 

"It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but, on the contrary, their social existence determines their consciousness." 

So The Free Software idea comes first before the all security ideas and practices. Because if you don't have the source code you can't protect it ! The point is not to understand something, nor do whatever you want to do. But having right for something that you don't want to do.

Freedom respecting solutions comes first for me ... which is why I do not run pentests to other people's systems. But I do only for our systems and the publicly available source code. This is our freedom ... 

jazz is democracy and a person is a person through other people and we are knitting a free society happy hacking ! 🇹🇷
