## ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡· About Me

- **Systems Programmer & Free Software Leadership:** I work full-time to lead global initiatives in Free Software and cyber security. I believe that true protection comes from having access to source codeâ€”if you donâ€™t have it, you canâ€™t truly secure it.
  
- **Philosophy:** My work is driven by the idea that our *social existence determines our consciousness*. This philosophy underpins my commitment to creating freedom-respecting solutions that champion openness over secrecy.
  
- **Cultural Explorer:** As I strive to become a world citizen, I embrace many human languages and diverse cultures, which enrich my open and collaborative approach.

## ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡· Conclusion

This profile and my projects are released under the [GNU Affero General Public License version 3 or later](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html). All my code is built on the principle that freedom starts with transparencyâ€”when you have access to the source, you have power over security.

I firmly believe that open communication and collaboration are the cornerstones of innovation. With every line of code, I strive to contribute to a digital future where knowledge is shared, security is inherent, and every person has the right to understand the tools they use.

Happy hacking, and let's keep building a Free Society with Free Software together!
