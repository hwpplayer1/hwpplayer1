# On hacking

In this article I'm gonna try to describe my way to The Free Software with my own consciousness. What I try to do is to make a sound that is not perfect but acceptable by all Free Software hackers from a cultural perspective.

# The existing frameworks and contribution to them 

As far as I can see GNOME and KDE are the leading solutions for Desktop Environments for GNU/Linux and also they give us a set of applications and development toolkits , software frameworks. Maybe KDE's Qt is a better framework when we compare with GNOME's GTK in the sense of cross platform development and a better enterprise ready system. But my approach will be different from now on and I want to support both but if an application is a Free Software and has an open and friendly community.

# Git is the tool to support existing projects

Git version control tool makes easier to hack new software or existing software on any OS. For instance if we work on GIMP or Kdenlive we can fork the source code base and change it in another branch. Then we can raise a PR(Pull Request) to the upstream. I'll provide training sessions for that.

# I'm searching to write my own software

In any case I want to write my own software from the lowest level, the kernel, the compiler, linker, shell, GUI and application software framework and also internet services which is self hosted. I believe that this is my right to make.

What makes me to think about this is I want to make my own centralized Free Software suite rather than struggling with many other different providers , individuals and organizations. But outsiders will be able to fork the projects so my approach is not one hundred percent "centralized". I mean I want to write my own code rather than waiting for help from others.

Thanks and happy hacking !
