# Hero or Leader ? The way of Leadership !

We don't need heroes ... Why ? Let's discuss here ... Let's begin what I mean...

# Hero

Hero is related with altruism and it is about an extremist way of collaboration. That does not make any sense in long term. Because "in long term all we are dead". But we need culture like African Ubuntu Culture and way of living for our daily lifes. And also we need organizations from our families, small or large size enterprises and our national states.

# Leadership rather than a single leader

In this context I don't mean collective or individual way of leadership. What I mean the history begins with a leader but then it grows up, things changes, and there we see many other leaders. The way it should be is like that. "In my humble opinion."

Because trust is the key for the leaders, and leaders without followers is not a leadership type. Then we can see followers as new leaders.

happy hacking with our African culture which is called Ubuntu !

hakuna matata !
