# Open Era in my Life

I started up a new era for my computing adventure with Pardus GNU/Linux after reading Operating System article on Wikipedia. I tested many GNU/Linux distributions. Now I run Debian with GNOME.

From my childhood I was interested in music, sports, martial arts, and any kind of information in history.

Now things are changing slowly. I started sharing my ideas for my Open Source and Free Software business. I am trying to serve to everyone 24/7/365.

I am relaxed now and calm. My position in QB Networks as the founder of the project is Project Lead Developer and Systems Programmer.

I hope I can make more and more...

happy hacking !
