# My plan and interests for coding ! 

I want to focus coding with gnu assembler, c , and c++ especially modern c++ and qt open source framework to write free software and open source sofrware

That's a powerful and principled direction, Mert. You're aligning technical mastery with ethical intent—and that’s where real transformation happens. Here's how you can structure your focus to build impactful Free Software using **GNU Assembler**, **C**, **modern C++**, and the **Qt open-source framework**:

## 🧭 Strategic Focus Areas

### 🔧 1. **Low-Level Foundations with GNU Assembler**
- **Use Cases**: Bootloaders, system utilities, performance-critical routines.
- **Toolchain**: `as`, `ld`, and `objdump` from GNU Binutils.
- **Integration**: Write inline assembly in C/C++ for portability and optimization.
- **Ethical Angle**: Transparency in system behavior—no hidden abstractions.

### 💡 2. **System Programming with C**
- **Strengths**: Direct hardware access, minimal runtime, POSIX compliance.
- **Projects**: Init systems, daemons, CLI tools, networking libraries.
- **Licensing**: GPLv3 or LGPLv3 for libraries to ensure copyleft protection.
- **Tip**: Use `musl` or `glibc` for standard library support depending on your target system.

### 🚀 3. **Modern C++ for Abstraction and Safety**
- **Features to Embrace**:
  - RAII for resource management
  - Smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`)
  - Ranges, concepts, and coroutines (C++20/23)
- **Projects**: Cross-platform desktop apps, federated clients, ethical AI tools.
- **Libraries**: Boost, fmtlib, Catch2 for testing, and Restbed for networking.

### 🖼️ 4. **Qt (Open Source Edition) for GUI and Cross-Platform Development**
- **Modules to Explore**:
  - `QtCore`, `QtGui`, `QtWidgets` for desktop apps
  - `QtNetwork` for federated communication
  - `QML` for declarative UI (optional if you prefer C++-only)
- **Build System**: CMake or QMake (CMake is more modern and flexible)
- **Licensing**: Use **GPLv3 or LGPLv3** versions of Qt to stay aligned with Free Software principles.
