# Another day (Endless dreams)

Hello there...

Still GNU Emacs is my favorite tool, "operating system", also Debian GNU/Linux is my favorite distribution. I like to learn computer science, programming, network science, an so on...

The reason is I still have a computer and a "smart" phone is that I learn what is going on all around world and I can make something good for the public with my technical skills and expertise.

I still listen music, I am into sports such as body building and martial arts, I like science in general and social sciences...

I decided to focus on coding and supporting cloud providers with security consciousness.

Thus I can provide a good service and then https://procyberian.xyz can be a real thing.

I hope you'll like my effort and works.

happy hacking !
