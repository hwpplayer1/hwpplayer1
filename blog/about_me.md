# About Me

Masscollabs Services is a Cloud Platform for Free Software people and my e-mail is mertgor@masscollabs.xyz and my GPG Key ID is 0x03E547D043AB6C8F

I work full-time to lead to The Free Software Movement globally. This is my main activity and I don't want to give up ... so happy hacking !Â 

"It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but, on the contrary, their social existence determines their consciousness."Â 

So The Free Software idea comes first before the all security ideas and practices. Because if you don't have the source code you can't protect it ! The point is not to understand something, nor do whatever you want to do. But having right for something that you don't want to do.

Freedom respecting solutions comes first for me ... which is why I do not run pentests to other people's systems. But I do only for our systems and the publicly available source code. This is our freedom ...Â 

jazz is democracy and a person is a person through other people and we are knitting a free society happy hacking ! ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·
