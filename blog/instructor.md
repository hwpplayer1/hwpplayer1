# Instructor and BDFL

Hello hackers !

As a BDFL , I deal with science, training for all , R&D, communication with other organizations , project design and decision making, organizational integrity of us, developer tools, and system administration tools/IT infrastructure, while the Project Lead Developer will organize Developer Core Teams and vice versa. For now I am also Project Lead Developer as a Systems Programmer

The goal is to empower newcomers as contributors, train them with the skills to reach leadership positions, and enable them to provide service.

In short, I'm an instructor for everyone :) The systems programmer role requires this anyway. 

I'm someone who can program hardware, also proficient in operating systems and low-level programming, has a strong understanding of programming languages, compilers and interpreters, works in computer science, and can work in the fields in general, hardware and software fields.

I like to play chess and go game. I want to write a game engine for go game and train our own ai models with this go game.

Time will tell !

happy hacking !
