# BDFL & Project Lead Developer & Systems Programmer of PSD

I am the Benevolent dictator for life (BDFL) , Project Lead Developer and Systems Programmer of PSD project. It is an open organization like BSD and Debian. We write cross platform applications and PSD GNU/Linux distribution which is based on Debian GNU/Linux. We also have a unique operating system and kernel project.

My role is to teach programming to newcomers and all community members. I also run security tests to our own domains and servers.

In long term I will be same BDFL but project leader, core team leaders, committers will be elected by community members.

This way I will protect Free Software and Open Source ethics and community will be more open and collaborative.

Thanks

happy hacking
