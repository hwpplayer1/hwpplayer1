# Chaos and Mind : A strategy for adaptive software solutions

In Open Source Community(ies) there are many many software packages and projects. Which is why we need communities and companies. Also other organizations...

On my take to stay alive and design and apply proactive solutions I focus on core abilities that is related with human perception. Like art of war and strategy.

Today I run GNU/Linux but it is not the end.

So to stay calm and relax in "chaos" I lead for a core community including scientists and artists.

Let's make some noise !

happy hacking !
